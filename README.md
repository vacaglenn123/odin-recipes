# Odin Recipes

A beginner HTML project built during The Odin Project Foundations course.  
This site helps me practice creating simple pages, organizing files, and using links in HTML.

##  Key Highlights

- A project to practice HTML fundamentals: structure, links, and basic page layouts. 
- Consists of a main page (`index.html`) and recipe pages inside a `recipes/` folder.
- Links between pages:  
  - From `index.html` → recipe pages  
  - From each recipe page → back to `index.html` for navigation.
- Use of boilerplate HTML (doctype, html/head/body tags) in each page. 
- Iterative building:  
  - Start with structure → add recipe page(s) → add content (images, ingredients, steps) → add more recipes.
