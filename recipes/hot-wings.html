    <h2>Ultimate Guide to Making Chicken Wings</h2>

    <p>Game day isn’t complete without a plate of hot wings, and this recipe is the ultimate crowd-pleaser! 
Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and coated in a spicy, buttery sauce, these wings are 
guaranteed to disappear fast. Whether you like them blazing hot or just mildly spicy, my recipe 
lets you adjust the heat level so everyone is happy — making it the best game day snack you’ll ever serve.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds frozen chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 cups hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange frozen chicken wings in a single layer in a shallow baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Flip wings over and continue to cook until skin is crispy and meat is no longer pink at the bone, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine hot sauce, butter, and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until butter melts, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour until sauce is smooth, then continue to cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Drain grease from chicken wings and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a large bowl and add sauce. Toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
